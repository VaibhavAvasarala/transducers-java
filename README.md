# transducers-java

Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate aggregates.

# Transducing functions

TODO

```java
ITransducer<String, Long> stringify = map(new Function<Long, String>() {
    @Override
    public String apply(Long i) {
        return i.toString();
    }
});
```

TODO - 

```java
IStepFunction<List<String>, String> addString = new IStepFunction<List<String>, String>() {
    @Override
    public List<String> apply(List<String> result, String input, AtomicBoolean reduced) {
        result.add(input);
        return result;
    }
};
```

The `addString` function supplies the knowledge of how to accumulate the result of an operation.  In this case, `addString` accepts a list and a `String` instance and adds it to the end of the list.  One of the most common ways to apply transducers is with the `com.cognitect.transducers.Fns#transduce` function, which is analogous to a standard `reduce` or `foldl` function found in many functional programming languages.  

```java
transduce(stringify, addString, new ArrayList<String>(), longs(10));

//=> ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
```

### Composing transducers

TODO

```java
ITransducer<Long, Long> filterOdds = filter(new Predicate<Long>() {
    @Override
    public boolean test(Long num) {
        return num.longValue() % 2 != 0;
    }
});			
```

Transducers are composed using the `com.cognitect.transducers.Fns#compose` method:

```java
ITransducer<String, Long> stringifyOdds = filterOdds.comp(stringify);
```

The transducer `stringifyOdds` is a transformation stack that will be applied by a process to a series of input elements. Each function in the stack is performed before the operation it wraps.

```java
transduce(stringifyOdds, addString, new ArrayList<String>(), longs(10));

//=> ["1", "3", "5", "7", "9"]
```
